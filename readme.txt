HOW TO RUN:
Run on terminal from project root directory "./make.sh"

Ensure managerLogin.csv exists in bin folder with ""Manager","password"" filled in.

manually in the backend, otherwise anyone can access the manager page.
As shown above, the login for manger is "Manager" as username and "password" as password
